Portfolio Project – Arta Kjato

This is my portfolio project built during the Technigo Web Development Bootcamp.
The goal was to create a simple and clear personal site showing who I am, what I’m learning, and the projects I’m building as I grow into software development.

The portfolio is built with React, using components, props, styled components, and a structure that follows the Figma design provided by Technigo.

🚀 Tech & Tools

React

Styled Components

JavaScript (ES6+)

Netlify for deployment

Git & GitHub for version control

Figma (design reference)

Lighthouse (accessibility and performance checks)

✨ Features

Reusable components for sections like About, Skills, Projects and Contact

Props to pass data into components cleanly

Responsive layout (mobile-first, works from 320px to 1600px+)

Styled Components for scoped, clean styling

Accessible content, including:

Alt text for all images

Proper color contrast

Lighthouse score above 95

Links to my projects, each connecting to GitHub and the live demo

Clear contact section so people can reach me easily

👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a junior software developer currently studying at Technigo, working across the stack with JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Node.
Before moving into tech, I worked in people-focused roles, which now influences how I think about users, communication and building clear digital experiences.

This portfolio is the first step in showing my work as I grow into the field.
